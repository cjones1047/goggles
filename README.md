# project-1

1) User will navigate to webpage and see a layout depicted in pic1 with an empty input bar on the bottom (which is disabled for the moment), a button that says "Let's play" on the bottom, and a summary of the game above it, which will be called Goggles. The summary will say:

2) 'Goggles is a game where you are trying to guess a secret word (which is going to be one of 100 different random but popular Google search words) based on a picture, similar almost to a game of charades. You will need to hit the button that says "Let's play" to get your first picture, but hints will be given with each incorrect guess in the form of a new picture.

3) After you get your first picture, the "Let's play" button will change into a "Guess" button in pic2 but you will still have the input bar which will no longer be disabled

4) pic3 shows the first guess being wrong and what the page would look like for the second guess. The first image is "X"'d out for a visual on how many guesses you've used.

5) pic4 shows a variation where as you get guesses wrong you will see your remaining guesses, but they will be grayed out regardless

6) If you use all 6 guesses and don't get the secret word, the "guess" bar will change to something like "aww, let's play again" and the images will all be "X"'d out like in pic5

7) If you win there will be confetti and baloons randomly generated everywhere, and the guess bar will celebrate you winning like in pic6
